Monday begins step 1 to a healthier lifestyle, and I've decided to share with you all the exercise plan that I have created. After doing some research on the internet, I've combined my past experience working out with the intelligence of AI (Copilot) to create a 7-day full body workout plan. I then used Chat GPT (OpenAI) to turn the workout plan into a markdown file so that I could blog it with you all.

## Why Full Body?

Full-body workouts provide a comprehensive approach to fitness, offering numerous benefits such as time efficiency, balanced muscle development, increased caloric burn, and improved functional fitness. They are versatile and effective for a wide range of fitness goals, making them a great option for anyone looking to improve their overall health and fitness.

Incorporating compound movements into your full-body workouts maximizes efficiency, functional strength, and overall muscle development. They offer numerous benefits that are not achievable through isolation exercises alone, making them a cornerstone of effective strength training programs.

## The 7 Movements in Full Body Workouts

In full-body workouts, seven fundamental movements are essential for achieving balanced muscle development and functional fitness. These movements are based on basic human movement patterns and are crucial for creating a well-rounded exercise routine.

The first movement, the squat, involves bending at the knees and hips to lower the body and then standing back up, targeting the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core. The hinge movement, where the hips act as the primary pivot point with minimal knee bending, primarily engages the hamstrings, glutes, lower back, and core.

The push movement includes any exercise where you push weight or resistance away from your body, focusing on the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Conversely, the pull movement involves pulling weight or resistance towards your body, targeting the back, biceps, and forearms. The lunge is a unilateral lower body movement where one leg steps forward, backward, or to the side, and the body lowers down, working the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves.

Rotation movements, which involve twisting or rotating the torso, primarily engage the obliques and core, often including the hips and shoulders as well. Lastly, gait movements encompass walking, running, or carrying weight while moving, emphasizing the full body, particularly the legs, core, and shoulders. Incorporating these seven fundamental movements into your workout routine ensures comprehensive muscle engagement and enhances functional fitness, promoting overall strength, stability, and physical performance.

## Why HIIT Cardio?

High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is often superior to regular cardio for several reasons:

### 1. Efficiency
- **Time-Saving:** HIIT workouts are shorter, typically 20-30 minutes, providing significant benefits in less time.

### 2. Caloric Burn
- **Afterburn Effect:** HIIT increases post-exercise calorie burn (EPOC), leading to higher overall caloric expenditure.

### 3. Cardiovascular Health
- **Heart Health:** HIIT improves cardiovascular fitness and oxygen efficiency more effectively than steady-state cardio.

### 4. Muscle Retention
- **Muscle Maintenance:** HIIT helps maintain and build muscle mass, unlike regular cardio, which can lead to muscle loss.

### 5. Versatility
- **Variety:** HIIT includes diverse exercises, preventing boredom and targeting different muscle groups. It‚Äôs easily scalable for all fitness levels.

### 6. Metabolic Health
- **Insulin Sensitivity:** HIIT improves insulin sensitivity and reduces visceral fat, enhancing metabolic health.

### 7. Mental Health
- **Mood Improvement:** The intensity of HIIT releases endorphins, improving mood and reducing anxiety and depression.

In summary, HIIT provides greater efficiency, increased caloric burn, improved cardiovascular and metabolic health, better muscle retention, and enhanced mental well-being compared to regular cardio.
